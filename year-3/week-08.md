# Week 8

- name King-C files with some word as well, not just number

# CS50

- start at 1:06, more array stuff
- he introduces strings, and null byte terminator
- command line arguments `argv` and `argc`
- readability analysis...
- cryptography

- https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2019/fall/psets/2/readability/
- https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2019/fall/psets/2/caesar/

## TODO

- finish StoryLite
- unblock `https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2019/fall/psets/2/` path only
- make a check50 for caeser & readability
- make a video of me doing flashcards assignment
- write up all homework
- write reduxLite

## class

- go over baby steps strategy for C programs, break down into steps, make "mini programs"
- solve random walk in class
- go over strings a little - special null-terminated arrays
- argv argc: `int argc, char* argv[]` 
- string.h, strlen, and atoi
- brief demo of "StoryLite"
- talk about what Snowpack/Vite/Parcel/Webpack actually _are_...
- if time:  more on tailwind, do some class demo, talk about patterns, purgability, etc.

## homework

- monkey function literals
- readability
- caeser
- (PUNT till next weak) King C functions (only 3)
- f2: start the web-app repo, scaffolding Snowpack, TS, tailwind, then adding StoryLite, make a story for a hello-world component

## next week...

- ReduxLite...


## King C (for week 9)

01 - [√] - simple selection sort, a simple recursive sort fn
02 - [x] - redu 5.5 with a function, probably not
03 - [x] - just use functions to do random walk, students should have already done that
04 - [•] - redo anagrams from ch. 7 w/ functions (maybe worth it, see if students use fns)
05 - [x] - re-doing one i assigned only as Kiah credit
06 - [√] - function to compute polynomial
07 - [•] - more efficient exponents (not sure, a bit mathy, maybe extra credit?)
08 - [√] - game of Craps
