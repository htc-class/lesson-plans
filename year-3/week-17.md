# Week 17

## cs50 things (starting at 24:03)

he goes over char * and basic pointer arithmatic
talks a decent bit about the concept of C strings, so it fits good with the King C chapter we did last time
goes over strcmp comparing strings directly 

## CLASS API
- walk them through the API migrations homework, and the timestamp stuff
- talk them through fiddling and testing in Sequal Pro/ace, trying ALTER table statements
- looking them up on mysql.dev, using Execute program cheat sheets, etc. 
- figure out the SQL before you write the migration

probably stop at 58:44

## homework plan:

- monkey
- king c
- watch CS50
- API user migrations?
  - run your migrations in production
  - convert timestamp fields
  - add user
  - add user_id field to cards (FK)
- web app? get it flippin...

## class... ???

- a bit more talking through pm2 staging/prod migrations
- maybe go over harriet's question why you can't just start stuffing chars in to a var declared with `char *x;`
  - the trick with C is you always have to know in advance how much memory you want
  - which reveals the fact that high level languages hide this detail from you
- typescript generics? generic constraints?
- review joins?
