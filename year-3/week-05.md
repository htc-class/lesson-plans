# Week 5

pp projects (some of them have been a bit lean...)
review your own diffs on GitLab for slacking.
Talk through monkey, work then read
review pointers, then...
solve `credit` in front of them...
while teaching about debugging

C debugging...

conceptualizing arrays in C


## CS50

35:20 (start)

- memory layout, grid, ram
- arrays
- `const`
- global variables (scope)

- 5 minute break at 1:06...


## King C things

- we will use the C99 style:

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  //
}
```


Ch 6. projects:
- √ 1 (find largest number)
- √ 2 (GCD) (maybe XC?)
- √ 3 (lowest terms) (use function from prob 2)
- X 4 (broker's commission) SKIP
- √ 5 (reverse arbitrary length numbers) (maybe omit, if too long?)
- √ 6 (print even squares between 1 and entered "n")
- X 7 (rewrite square3.c) probably SKIP
- √ 8 (print calendar) looks fun 👍
- X 9 (modify loan balance from ch. 2) SKIP, i didn't assign that one
- √ 10 (which date is earliest, arbitrary number), coach to extract function from ch. 9
- • 11 **Extra Credit: ✨** (compute approximation of e)

### homework:
King C
Monkey
PP

## next week class

arrays in C
parse 2 + 3 * 4 on whiteboard

## next week homework

flashcards, pull categories with a separate query
extra credit, learn about promise.all to do the queries simultaneously
