## Week 10

### in class...

big concepts:
 - redux review
 - tailwind classNames props, and "inner/outer" class thinking
 - jest testing, layers of testing
 - making things easy to test (abstractions, pulling out "services"), extracting a pure shell, mocking
 - maybe discuss "static storage duration" in C
 - maybe idea of "models" ?

- redux: review/draw
- redux: talk about when to make a container component, when to use presentational components
- redux: prep for DA videos (not confined to react, i.e., i use it for Gertie)
- redux: PUNT -- maybe go over thunks? (if homework will include it)

### homework ideas...

- READ THE DOCS! (jest)
- jest tests for reducer of web-app
- jest tests API side, w/ abstraction
- flashcards webapp: fetch cards from API w/ thunk ???

- next king C chapter
- watch some CS50
- another monkey

BIG ROCKS:
- monkey
- king c
- jest webapp
- jest API
- read the docs
- DA videos (long)
- CS50 video
--- probably punt ----
- personal project ??? (candidate for netlify)
- webapp fetch ??? (probably save for next week)


### possible todos...

- add a bit more documentation on using `fldev`, copy over to GitLab
- prep deploying with netlify

### NEXT TIME...

- Netlify
- Thunks
