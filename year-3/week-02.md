# Week 2

- making a new branch rant!

TS/JS
- brief into to Map and Set, in JS/TS (have them read the MDN)

- first talk about the IDEA of a map
MAP: `.size .get(), .set(), .has(), .keys(), .values(), .entries(), .delete(), .clear() .forEach`
- implements iterator, so can use with `for...of`
- upsides, speed, expressive syntax, no key pollution
- downside - no native JSON conversion
SET: `size .add(), .has(), .clear(), .delete(), .values(), .forEach()`
- talk about spreading them in and out of arrays...
- briefly talk about TS Enums
- talk about "Read the Docs!" homework

MONKEY - 
- precedence
- associativity
- quick review of infix/prefix/postfix, unary/binary/ternary
- the basic idea of Pratt parsing - tokens have 2 functions, for prefix & infix

C
- pausing CS50 after this, to work through problem sets
- gitignore !
- talk about extra credit approaches... modulo, while
- brace style in C
- functions, function declarations (prototypes) vs function definition
- loops in c: for, while loops, do-while loops
- define a "buffer"
- mention formatted input/output, but don't explain more

(if time...)
- review how to make a file a globally available command with permissions and PATH

## HOMEWORK

- read MDN on map and set
- read docs on TS enums
- next monkey
- king c, ch 3, ex 1 2 3 4
- cs50 to end of lecture 1
- mario (XC mario) (have them make an executable, with review)
- cash.c
- personal project

pset 1:
use get_string() to do a hello, <name>
mario (easier, harder)

cash.c
```c
Change owed: 0.41
4
# ...
Change owed: -0.41
Change owed: foo
Change owed: 0.41
4
```
0.41 -> 4
3.42 -> 17
0.01 -> 1
1.07 -> 7


credit.c
@see https://lab.cs50.io/cs50/labs/2019/fall/credit/


CS50

c-style for loops
functions (function declaration vs function definition (or function prototype))
do-while loop

floating point errors... (prob not)
