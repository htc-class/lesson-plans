# Week 7

2 weeks...
- monkey: Grouped Expressions and If Expressions
- king C (either half or ALL)
- read the docs (Tailwind) (post a slack explaining something cool...) 

- F2 (api) (.env, vscode rest client, htc simple mysql and add `/cards`, make sure dev/prod uses different dbs)
prettier?



future F2 (introduce MODELs, classes that represent things)
future F2 (maybe add jest, talk about mocking, making hard things testable)
future F2 (poor mans migrations...)
future F2 (have them try to scaffold snowpack+TS+tailwind)


## in class

- reminder to review your diffs! (Harriet)
- talk about slowing up on CS50 to get through array stuff
- VSCODE rest client?
- talk about how picky i am about the flashcards stuff, and why

- review King C's language of "single data item" and "aggregate" variables (structs and arrays)
- review language of `subscript-ing` or `index-ing` into an array
- review `lvalue` (something that can appear on the LEFT side of `<left> = <expression>`

- meta concept of arrays in memory, along with Type memory size

// should i cover these things? (probably not)
- arrays (going out of bounds) wheee undefined
- array initializers 


arrays are complex, and new, split into two weeks
- the next chapter is functions, which we basically already covered, do only in one week (fewer projects)

King C (chapter 8, arrays)
- 01 [√] - modify repeated digits (fairly easy)
- 02 [√] - modify repeated digits again, printing table of how many times
- 03 [√] - same as 02, in a while loop (just extract to a function first)
- 04 [x] - modify repdigit to use sizeof
- 05 [x] - modify chapter example to compound monthly instead of annually (nah, don't like interest maths stuff)
- 06 [√] - Biff speak
- 07 [?] - 5 x 5 matric (maybe extra credit...)
- 08 [?] - modify 07 to be matrix of test squares, average (not sure...)
-- maybe break here?
- 09 [√] - random walk (hard, skip for willow maybe, but FUN)
- 01 [x] - modifying something we skippef rom chapter 5
- 11 [?] - modify 7.4 (phone number letters) (not sure... we did do this one though...)
- 12 [√] - modify 7.5 (scrabble) (not too hard, really just practicing using initializers)
- 13 [x] - label Lloyd Fosdick (don't really understand)
- 14 [x] - reverse sentence (i don't get the hint.)
- 15 [√] - caeser (hard, but fun, coach to psuedo code and extract functions)
- 16 [V] - anagrams (hard ish, but cool)
- 17 [•] - magic squares (kiah credit)
