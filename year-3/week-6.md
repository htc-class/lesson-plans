## homework (rough)

- King C, chapter 7 (basic types)
- Monkey, boolean literals
- MySQL/Flashcards
- no CS50 vid or assignment this week

King ch. 7 projects

- X 1 - experiment with int types
- √ 2 - 'press enter to continue' (maybe skip)
- X 3 - prob skip, just changin a program from long to double

- √ 15 - factorial (yes)


## misc

- ch. 7 in King c is "Basic Types"
- ch. 8 is "arrays". so maybe slow down on CS50 until we get to arrays.

- should we start over our flashcards app with tailwind and simpler stories?

- tailwind?
- redux?
- redo flashcards?
- vscode restclient for testing API...


## future mysql...

- have them "start over", but split out the api into it's own repo
- have a rest client test file `test.http` 
- add authentication, go over passwords, tokens, encryption, cookies
- start from scratch with tailwind/snowpack/redux
- maybe a "poor man's redux?" / or maybe use real redux?
