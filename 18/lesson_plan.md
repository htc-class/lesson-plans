setTimeout(upperRight, 1000);
setTimeout(lowerRight, 1000);
setTimeout(lowerLeft, 1000);
goBackHome();
```

go over Tabitha's mistake (CLOSURE)

go over win's mistake (errors that don't show up unless you interact)

## actually do

- css background images
- element.setAttribute('href', '#');
- talk more about the DOM (show it in the dev tools)
- quick show addEventListener/removeEventListener
- appending nodes and removing them
- if statements
- regular expression objects
- prompt
- external js files
- mouseover / mouseout
- most things in javascripts are actually objects, or behave like objects
