## Week 3

## general

- new stuff, please read carefully

## TS

- restarting TS server in VSCODE
- more on typescript generics (make some of your own)
- intersections
- type narrowing

## JS

- spread
- shorthand
- Math.random() (because I use it in examples)
- truthy vs falsy
- || operator (xp)
- object access with square notation
- Object.keys(), Object.values()

# CSS gradients?

- https://estelle.github.io/CSS/gradients/index.html

# React

- difference between how primitive html elements get stuff for free like `style` and `onClick`
- `reconcile` -- how react works with the virtual dom under the hood
- more useState
- maybe talk a little about SPA's, why & when you would want to use react
- controlled components (form elements?)
- go over useEffect more (maybe talk about componentDidMount)


# Homework ideas

- something with react && an API using useEffect
- a more complicated state example?
- react madlib (forms)
