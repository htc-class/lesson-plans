# sent out via email (slack not set up yet)

Hey gang,

Still working on getting you guys all set up on Slack, so I'm going to send out the first part of the homework (at least) via email this week.

Here's a couple parts of the homework that you can do with no slack, and without needing to be able to "ssh" into our remote shared computer.

Part 1: CCCS #2

Here's the link for episode 2 of "Crash Course Computer Science":

Again, double-check with your parents before you watch it, so they know what you're doing.  This is another one that doesn't need to be watched twice, but if you want to, you'll absorb even more if you do watch it twice, a day or two apart.

Part 2: Typing!

Try to get in at least 2 days this week of a few minutes of slow, deliberate, careful typing practice.  Use the links I sent you last week.  Same instructions.  You're adult self will thank you in 10 years!

Part 3: Binary

Do a little "practice" with binary, to cement what we talked about yesterday.  First, on a piece of paper, write from 1-30 in binary (base 2).  Go further if you want. See if you notice any patterns, or if your brain starts thinking just a little bit in binary as you do so. Second, try to write the number 43, 69, and 104 in binary. For extra credit try making up a couple of addition problems in binary, and then try to solve them, like this:

 101
+ 11
----
????

That's it for now, I'll email you back later in the week if I'm able to get all of you sorted out with Slack and ssh, and then we'll add one or two short other practice things.
