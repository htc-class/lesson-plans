- review: `node` cmd, (also, `which`, $PATH,  repl, etc)
- review, shell expansions `*`, `?`, and `[...]`
- review | vs > >>

## homework prep work

- write up boolean/ternary rendering in React components
√ write up "new stuff" for UUIDs
√ write up homework for flashcards UUID delete handling
√ write up homework for personal project
√ akron snowmen writup

## homework (SETTLED)

- 2 part UUID/Delete Flashcards
- 1 part AS "bugged me" MR
- 1 part normal-sized chunk on personal project

## homework ideas (???)

Something Vim related? Vimtutor?

Flashcards:
* cards get UUID so they can be deleted (in 2 parts)
  - write a throw-away script to add uuids to existing cards
  - implement delete feature

Personal Project:
* maybe a larger chunk of personal project?

Akron Snowmen:
x (later)  maybe have them add 3 new interior pages for the 3 img/text blocks on homepage?
* maybe have them each find something that bugs them and fix it?

King exercizes?
