- how to use imported images as background images with inline-styles

- layered background images (use in AS)
- using linear-gradient as a way to fake a background "image" with just a color"
- explain/draw "article" or "content" page layout idea (take pictures maybe for homework)
- Officially show `Object.entries()`
