- vimtutor (2x)
- touch typing practice
- watch CCCS #1 (twice)
- download and sign up for our slack channel
- command-line practice (need some exercizes)
- review your flashcards

#### CLI practice

- ssh into your home dir
- make a new folder called `monday`
- move into that new folder
- type a command that will print the full path to the directory you're in
- create a new empty file (without using vim) called `hello.txt`
- create a file containing the word "testing" (w/o vim) called `test.txt`
- prove that the file contains "testing" by typing a command to print the contents to stdout
- now move back up to your home directory
- move BACK into your `monday` folder and then get BACK up to your home folder using a slightly different command
- all in one command, make a new folder inside your home dir called `one`, with a folder inside it called `two`, and a folder inside `two` called `three`
- print your current directory again, you should still be in your home dir
- now jump all the way into the `three` dir with ONE command
- using vim, create a new file called `name.txt` and put your first, middle, and last name on the first 3 lines

- use `man <CMD>` to explore one command we went over, learn something new to bring to class
