# Week 27

### CCCS

- not a lot to say here, interesting historical background

### Array.reduce review

- do step 31 as an exercize in front of the class
- do two kiah-credits in front of class as exercize

### More GIT

- `git merge <other>` (merges INTO receiving branch, where you currently ARE)
- `git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph`
- concept: fast-forward merge
- concept: merge commits
- concept: common "base" (eventually will lead to re-base-ing)
- shortcut: `git checkout -b <my-new-branch>`
- shortcut: `git commit -am "message"`


- HEAD is a reference to the last commit in the currently check-out branch.
- head is how git remembers which branch you're on

### CSS: hover states

- used to be just `<a>` tags, but now everything
- maybe LVHA 

### Node commonjs bare strings (if time)

- fs.readFileSync();
