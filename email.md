Hey friends,

I wanted to let you all know that I’m going to be starting a weekly computer class for any of the medium-old and up kids in our fellowship.

The class will cover a range of topics but will be generally aiming at introducing them to computer programming using web-development and web technologies primarily -- because that’s what I know best, and these are also the most ubiquitous right now, and lay the foundation very well for all other types of programming.

Harriet, Winfield, and Kiah for certain are going to be doing the class, and we'd be happy to have others. No prior experience needed at all. As far as age goes, I would say probably 12 or older, but use your discretion -- you know your kids better than I do. If you've got one on the young side, but you sense that they have the inclination and personality, then I'm happy giving it a go. I'll have to be adapting the work and learning pace across several different skill levels anyway. It's fine with me if they give it a shot and decide to quit after a few weeks too -- no long-term commitment needed. It would be great if a couple of kids who didn't think that they liked computers gave it a shot, they might be surprised.

As for timing and location: my current thought is that we'd do the class at our house on Mondays from 4:45pm to 6:15pm. It's kind of an odd time, but I was trying to work it into the schedule in a way that didn't add another evening to all of our schedules. My thought is that you could drop off anyone attending at our place, and we can take everyone in our two vehicles over to Costa's for meeting when we're done with class. Any adults or siblings not taking the class would also be welcome to hang out at our place during the class and before meeting, if driving back home is not feasible.

One of my motivations (beyond just general learning and computer literacy) for doing the class is that I'd like to expose some of our young people to computer programming as a possible career option. It's not for everyone, but for the right personality and mind, it can work out pretty well. It's a pretty highly-demanded skill set, and can bring a lot of flexibility in terms of finding work that is scruple-free and doesn't require moving.

To start out, I'm going to be teaching some of the really basic skills needed for programming, like using the command line, regular expressions, understanding the basics of how computers and programming languages get work done. I'll be building up towards them learning basic HTML and javascript, as well as critically useful skills like version control (with git) and collaborating on writing code with others. My hope is to have them before too long begin to collaborate on a simple but working web app, and use that as a playground for beginning to learn some of the many aspects of web development.

Long-term, if any of the kids show a real interest and aptitude for it, I'd be happy to work with those kids on a more individual and long-term basis, helping them grow their skillset and confidence in order to possibly do it professionally one day.

They'll need access to a computer, since I'm planning on a small amount of "homework" or practice time between classes -- around 15-25 minutes 3-4 times each week. Ideally, if they had a computer they could bring to the class, that would be great, but if not, we can work around that.

Let me know if you have any questions, I'll try to answer them.  I have a lot more thoughts, but this is already a bit long.  I have no idea what I'm doing with this, and might be a collossal failure, but I thought I'd give it a shot at least.

I'm thinking we'll start Monday, September 16.
