## Week 14 Lesson Plan

### Homework thoughts...

* complete verbatim first, then explore
* sometimes i give you repetative things on purpose, to hone your vim skills
* I _love_ the exploration

### CCCS Review

* everything gets compiled down to machine code
* psuedo-code
* an `assembler` reads in some higher-level text and boils it down to machine code
* assembly language has a 1-1 mapping of instructions to machine instructions, but going up one level is what Grace Hopper did
* a _compiler_ translates a higher-level language into assembly or machine code
* languages were originally tied to specific machines, until COBOL -- then each machine just had it's own _compiler_ but the COBOL language could be the same between machines

### CSS

* external stylesheets
* width and height
* inline-block
* introduce inline block
* floats

### processes in unix

* show the ps command
* processes have id `pid`, and an environment

### JS

* functions
* arrays
* objects
* `process` object
* getting `argv` in node and making a cli "app"
