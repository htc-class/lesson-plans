- remapping caps escape
- spend a little time talking about vim
- introduce concept of _types_, even numbers in binary need a code layered on top, and letters (ASCII, unicode), colors (RBG), etc, the same binary can mean multiple things, so we need the concept of types
- bash variables
  - `FOO=bar` `FOO="bar baz"` `echo "$FOO hash jaml"`
  - `$HOME $USER $SHELL $PAGER`
- bash exit codes `echo $?`
