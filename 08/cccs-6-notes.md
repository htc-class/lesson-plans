## Registers and Ram

volitle vs persistent
RAM vs hard drives

a BIT that can store information

AND-OR Latch "remembers" a single bit of memory, uses a "set" and "reset" wire
goes up higher to a "gated latch" which has a "data in" and a "write enable" 

a group of latches working together is called a REGISTER, number of bits in register is "width"
grid-based memory
RANDOM access, vs tape, hard drive.   FAST
