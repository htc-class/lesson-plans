## Week 20 Lesson Plan

CCCS
- integrated circuits
- etching transistors and wires into a chip
- Moore's law

Three big topics:

1. $PATH
2. CSS background images
3. Js regex


lots of mistakes comparing strings to numbers in node things, use as springboard to talk about == vs ===

$PATH

`which`

shebang

show `cowsay`, inspect shebang

for example, `format` is just `#!/bin/bash` then `prettier $1 --write`

js: prompt, regex literal, regex.replace, regex.match

css: background images
  - background-image
  - background-repeat
    - repeat-x, repeat-y, repeat
  - background-position
    - top, bottom, left, right, center / top left, top right, etc.
  - background-size
    - keyword: cover, contain
    - <width> <height>: 3em 25%, 50px auto 
  - background-attachment
    - fixed, scroll

css: `vw` and `vh`, 100vh is cool and fun

homework ideas:

node: regex imput things, test if input is valid SSN, phone number
node: regex phone number formatter
