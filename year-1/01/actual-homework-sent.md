# below was sent out as an email üëç

Hey gang,

Since we didn't get quite as far as I thought during class, our homework for week 1 will be pretty minimal.

Before using any of the links I'm putting below, make sure to talk with your parents. I sent them an email too, so that they can be clear on what exactly you're doing.

#1 CCCS Episode 1

Watch the first episode of Crash Course Computer Science (CCCS). Use this link (after talking to your parents!):

https://htc-viewer.netlify.com/?id=O5nskjZ_GoI

Because of the content of this one isn't super technical or complicated, just watching it once would be OK, but if you have time and interest, watch it twice!

#2 Typing Practice

For at least 3 days, do 10-15 minutes of slow, careful, deliberate typing practice.  Remember neural networks!  If you don't have a typing program, try one of these two websites (again, after clearing it with your parents):

https://www.how-to-type.com
https://touchtype.co

Pick a lesson that is a little bit easier than your skill level, and work up.  On the second site, scroll down to the footer to find the links to all of the lessons.

#3 Flash Cards

While it's still fresh in your mind, see if you can make flash cards for these terms. If you can't remember what they all mean or do, just write out the term on one side and bring them to class with you, we'll review. But write out as many definitions as you can remember, in your own words:
standard in
standard out
pwd
ls
rm
mkdir
man
touch
mv
cat
You should have gotten a little pile of index cards, but if you didn't, see if your parents have some you can use.

Extra Credit: Using the terminal

If you want, and you can figure out how, try to pull up a "terminal" application (on Mac, from the Finder app, use the top "Go" menu and choose "Utilities", on Windows, try searching for "Powershell", on Chromebook try typing "CTRL+ALT+T").  If you can get to a command prompt, then play with the commands listed above.  None of them are dangerous except for "rm" but even that requires some advanced knowledge to do any harm, so play around and maybe for now avoid typing "rm".  Especially see if you can bring up some of the "manual" pages.
