## Week 23 Lesson Plan

### CCCS

- "data about data" is called metadata
- file headers
- what really IS a file, computer just has streams of binary back to back
- directory file (like a table of contents)
- directory files point to files and other directories
- files don't actually have to move when you move a file into another dir, they just SEEM to

### vim

- <ctrl-I> and <ctrl-O> for jumping

### JS

- brief review of FUNCTIONS
  - always return something, at least undefined
  - calling context can ignore what they return
  - parameters are the name of inputs
  - arguments are the actual inputs that go in
  - side effects can happen
  - idempotent / pure / impure
- other function declaration style - function declaration
  - advantage: get preloaded
  - disatvantage: they confuse you into thinking they're special

- super brief review of OBJECTS
- functions attached to objects are called METHODS
- if you saw this line of code: `foo.bar` what would you know about `foo`... ðŸ¤”
- javascript treats lots of things like objects, giving you fun things for free, like:
  - array.length
  - string.match()
  - string.test()

### String methods:

- string.toUpperCase(), string.toLowerCase()
- string.includes
- string.startsWith
- string.endsWith
- string.split

### Array methods:

- array.pop() (MUTATE)
- array.push() (MUTATE)
- array.join();
- array.includes();
- array.map()
- array.filter()
- array.forEach()

### CSS: hover states (if time)


### Homework Ideas:

- redo loop homework from last week, using foreach.
- figure out what array.pop and array.push return
- figure out what array.forEach returns

- flashcards
- maybe a vimtutor refresher?
- speller "Your name is spelled J-A-R-E-D
- without.js
- whipser.js
- shout.js
