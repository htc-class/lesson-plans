## go over a few thoughts about doing homework

* don't worry about if you're bugging me
* review the "new stuff learned"
* review your flashcards
* i sometimes won't answer, it's never because I'm annoyed

## vim

* brief review of stuff from last week
* focus on `ci"` or variants
* focus on `.` to repeat
* focus on `fx` and `tx`

## Regex

* `\b` - word boundary
* `\w` - word character
* `?` - Lazy - makes the preceding quantifier lazy

## Introduce CSS

* basic box-model stuff: margin, border, padding
* background color
* font color
* inline vs block elements
* div
* span
* tables
* units: `px`, `em`, `%`
* cover these exactly:
  - margin
  - padding
  - border-color
  - border-width
  - color
  - background-color
  - font-family
  - font-size
