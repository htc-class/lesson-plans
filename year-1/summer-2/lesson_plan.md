# Summer 2 Lesson Plan

## CCCS (Machine Learning)

## Review

- cp command
- bash variables

## `import fs from 'fs'`

review require(), how it was a _function_ not language feature or syntax

## TS: 

* void type
* named types with `type T = ...`
* object-y things
* tuples

## Promises

* node `utils.promisify`
