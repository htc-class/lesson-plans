# Week 18

## (IN CLASS ~~ actually do)

- show using `let` to slowly build up a string instead of ternary death [5 min, 4:05]
- diagram, talk through Flashcards next step, (high-level) [10 min, 4:15]
- the idea of REST-ful resources [10 min, 4:25]
- POST-ing json with window.fetch [5 min, 4:30]
- handling different "routes" with http module [5 min, 4:35]
- moving card data file out of version control [5 min, 4:40]
- maybe go over PM2? so they can have a build server? [5 min, 4:45]
- /dev/null and `&>` (redir both stderr and stdout) [5 min, 4:50]
- talk through <Layout /> component assignment [5 min, 4:55]
- `&` and job control, fg/bg (need to add to new stuff maybe if i do it)
- {IF TIME} // @ts-expect-error
- {IF TIME} typechecking a function in TS

[next week]
- javascript Dates, basic (for timetamping added cards)

- typechecking a function in TS
- chown
- bash `&` and job control...
- maybe some array practice (use King `C` book for inspiration?)
- javascript Date object fun?

#### King Exercizes (left of looking at 123.5)
- program to turn `45` into `"forty-five"`, etc (97)
- dollar amount to smallest number of bills (page 34), function w/jest plus a user interface to accept input? or maybe cli args?
- enter two dates, (format `"mm/dd/yy"`), calculate which one is earlier...
- compute GCD (greatest common divisor) using Euclid's algorithm (122) [maybe also, simplify fraction using GCD]
- find all even squares less than n. ~ f(100) should equal [4, 16, 36, 64, 100] ~ (123)
- ??? compute UPC check digit (56)
- ??? closest air flight arrival/departure time from table (96)

#### {PREP TASKS}

√ write "new stuff" for posting JSON
√ write "new stuff" for handling different routes
√ write "new stuff" for REST api resources
√ write up Flashcards homework
√ merge the nav assignment
√ write up AS assignments

later...
- prep for AS deployment (get netlify-cli installed, working)

## Homework ideas...

### Flashcard app
 - submit new card?
 - new card validation? (no empty strings)
 - store new card in plain json file
 - handle building on PROD_API_PORT
 - (future?) do you allow new categories to be added?

## Akron Snowmen
 - ??? maybe assign each kid one chunk to modify/incorporate new text from win and harriet?
 - ??? extract a <Layout /> component for use with inner pages?
 - ??? team member component
 - ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯
 
## Future Project X
 - assign a starter task?
 - storyboard something? if applicable
 - maybe make them create an app skeleton from a boilerplate, if it makes sense?
